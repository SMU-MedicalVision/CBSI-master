# Welcome to CBSI!
**Contrast-free BBB Status Identification model (CBSI)** is a generative diffusion AI that can identify BBB status with high accuracy using non-contrast MR images including T1 and T2-FLAIR MR scans.

This repository contains the code to our paper "Contrast-free identification of glioma blood-brain barrier status via generative diffusion AI and non-contrast MRI".

# System Requirements
This code has been tested on Ubuntu in PyTorch and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. 

# Setup Environment
In order to run our model, we suggest you create a virtual environment
```
conda create -n CBSI_env python=3.8
```
and activate it with
```
conda activate CBSI_env
```
Subsequently, download and install the required libraries by running
```
pip install torch==2.0.0+cu118 torchvision==0.15.1+cu118 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Prepare Dataset
To simpify the dataloading for your own dataset, we provide a default dataset that simply requires the path to the folder with your NifTI images inside, i.e.
```
Train/                               Test/                        # Path to the folder that contains the images
├── ET-1 	# ET label               ├── PA_001                   # ID is not important and can be randomly generated to ensure anonymity
    ├── ID_001                               ├── T1.nii.gz        # The sequence of the NifTI (strictly consistent)
            ├── T1C.nii.gz                   ├── T2F.nii.gz       
            ├── T1.nii.gz            ├── PA_002            
            ├── T2F.nii.gz                   ├── T2F.nii.gz
            ├── ROI.nii.gz                   ├── T1.nii.gz     
        Generated by BET             ├── ...

If needed, you may consider downloading the glioma public dataset from [BraTS 2023 Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn51156910/wiki/).

Before training, the data needs to be preprocessed by **'Grayscale Normalization'** and mapped to the range of 0 to 255 by executing the following command
```
bash ./preprocess/Preprocess_grayscale_norm.sh
```


# Training
First, you need to train the condictional diffusion model. To do so in prepared dataset, you can run the following command:
```
python ./main/train_CBSI_gen.py
```
Second, you need to train the identiifcation model by runing the following command:
```
python ./main/train_CBSI_ide.py
```
Note that you need to provide the path to the dataset (e.g. `dataset.root_dir='/data/BraTS/BraTS 2023'`) to successfully run the command.
You can use the following command to observe the loss curve of the training process, visualize the sample image, etc.
```
tensorboard --lodgir ./main/trained_models/CBSI_gen/(model save filename)
```

# Inference
In the inference stage, synthesis and identification are performed together. You can do this by running the following command:
```
python ./main/Inference.py
```
